    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Dutch oven carnitas recipe is requested by friends and family <i>repeatedly</i>. Many find carnitas a little dry or flavorless, but these have a great, distinctive flavor. Serve with warm, fresh tortillas and salsa.</p>
        <p>I made this as directed with the exception of the pork as I had lefover pork roast that was already shredded for pulled pork. I halved the recipe based upon the amount of port I had available. I did add one can of mild diced green chilis and a couple tablespoons of chopped jalapeno. Since I used pork that was already cooked, I made the sauce and brought it to a boil and tasted to ensure the flavor was there before adding the pork. I simmered on low heat for 45 minutes before transferring to the sheet pan. I finished the recipe as printed. This was <i>very tasty</i> and will be making again.</p>

        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until pork is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid. Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pork pieces and lightly season with salt.</li>
        <li>Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork as it browns.</li>
